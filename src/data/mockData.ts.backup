One day, her grandmother gave her a special bracelet and said, 'Each time someone shows you kindness, add a bead to remember.' At first, Maya struggled to find kindness. But then she noticed her brother sharing his lunch, her teacher's encouraging words, a friend's smile. Soon, her bracelet was full of colorful beads, each one a reminder of goodness in her life. Maya realized gratitude wasn't about having everything—it was about noticing the good that was already there."\n\n3. Discussion (2 minutes):\n   - What did Maya learn?\n   - How can we practice gratitude daily?\n\n4. Activity (2 minutes):\n   - Each student shares ONE thing they're grateful for today\n   - Keep it brief and positive\n\n5. Close with a positive affirmation: "Today, I choose to notice the good around me."`

Perspective Activity (3 minutes):\n   - Divide class in half\n   - Half argues from Alex's perspective\n   - Half argues from Jordan's perspective\n   - Switch and argue from opposite view\n\n3. Discussion (2 minutes):\n   - How did your thinking change?\n   - Why is understanding others' perspectives important?\n\n4.
